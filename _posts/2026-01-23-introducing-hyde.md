About Me

I am a Data Science and Economics professional with a strong background in financial analysis, economic research, and data-driven decision-making. Currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Data Science & Economics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights for business and policy contexts.

My experience spans financial planning, budgeting, forecasting, and feasibility studies across both corporate and research environments. I have worked as a financial analyst, economist, and accounting assistant, supporting strategic decisions through rigorous quantitative analysis and clear data storytelling. Alongside my professional experience, I am actively involved in academic research as a working student at IAMO, contributing to data collection, analysis, and research dissemination in an international setting.

Technically, I am proficient in Python, MATLAB, SQL, and Power BI, with solid experience in R, econometrics, and statistical modeling. I enjoy working at the intersection of economics, data science, and strategy, and I am motivated by projects where analytical rigor leads to real-world impact.
